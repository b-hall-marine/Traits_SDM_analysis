# Traits_SDM_analysis

README

The following readme describes the structure of the R code used for the manuscript titled "Identifying high risk seafloor areas to bottom trawling in Aotearoa New Zealand to support marine spatial management" authored by Benjamin Hall, Matthew Bennion, Orlando Lam-Gordillo, Clare Fitzsimmons and Fabrice Stephenson.

R CODE:

The work flow for this code is to utilize one R code:

 1. Trait_SDM_analyses.R - This code is used to load packages and functions, read in the available rasters of the SDMs and Uncertainties, Read in the vulnerability scores and trait linked information, Prep files and output information, Stack the taxa traits, loop to apply the vulnerability scores, save all applied files, Map individual triats, a calcuation of functional metrics (not used the manuscript) and a final calculation of functional redundancy.


The individual input files, for instance the species SDMs and the New Zealand Trait Database are avialble on request from NIWA.
